# PowerStat's OpenKarotzApi

This is a minimal Java implementation of the OpenKarotz API which will be extended by generated code.

* [Open Karotz API](http://www.openkarotz.org/api/)


## Installation

Because this library is only useful for developers the installation depends on your build environment.

For example when using Apache Maven you could add the following dependency to your project:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>de.powerstat.openkarotz</groupId>
      <artifactId>openkarotzapi</artifactId>
      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>

Please add the following entry to your maven `settings.xml`:

    <server>
      <id>nvd</id>
      <password>nvd api-key</password>
    </server>

The API-Key could be requested here: [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key)

Other build tools like gradle will work analogous.

To compile this project yourself you could use:

    mvn clean install org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage site
    
or simply:

     mvn clean install

or for native image creation:

On windows Visual Studio 2022 is required and you have to call:

    "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat" > nul

Compile and build image:

    mvn clean -Pnative package
    
Run the image:

    ./target/[imagename]

To run toolchain:

    mvn toolchains:toolchain
    
If you use a sonar server:

    mvn sonar:sonar -Dsonar.login=<username> -Dsonar.password=<password>

If you use [infer][https://fbinfer.com/]:

    infer run -- mvn clean compile

To create a spdx:

    mvn spdx:createSPDX

To create a cycloneDX:

    mvn cyclonedx:makeBom
    
To upload bom to dependency-track:

    mvn dependency-track:upload-bom
    
To look for dependency-track findings: 

    mvn dependency-track:findings
